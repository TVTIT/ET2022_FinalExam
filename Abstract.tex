Spatial correlation between antennas plays a critical role in the performance of wireless communication systems. This paper uses simulations method to examine the correlation across different environments, aiming to determine which environment offers the most stable signal performance. In this paper, I inspect correlations amplitude values in three environments: Urban Micro (UMi), Rural Macro (RMa) and Indoor. Also, we analyze the spatial correlations in both BS and MS sides. Peak and minimum points are identified to evaluate the rate of signal correlation to each environment. The simulation results in the indoor environment provides the most consistent and reliable transmission conditions. Finally, I conclude that using this simulation method to simulate the correlation in different environments.
