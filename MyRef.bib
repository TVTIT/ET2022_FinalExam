	abstract = {Abstract This paper compares two types of channel modeling methods, which are the spatial channel modeling (SCM) and the Onering channel modeling method. These two well-known channel models are proposed for 4G wideband mobile communication networks. To compare the performance of these channel modeling methods, we analyze the properties of the spatial, temporal, frequency correlation functions simulated by using these methods. The correlation functions of the two channel models are compared in the same conditions of antenna arrangements. The simulation and calculation results show that the correlation functions of Onering and SCM channel models are very close to each other if the BS and the MS antenna arrays are parallel and perpendicular to the broadside of MS-BS. In other cases, the correlation functions of the two models are slightly different; however, their shapes are similar. These differences can be explained that the Onering model hardly fully describes all the characteristics of 4G channels as the performance SCM model does. The performance of these channel modeling methods is compared in system simulation level—MIMO-OFDMA systems. The combination SFBC-MMSE is used for spatial channel coding and the signal detection. The simulation results show that the system performance obtained by using these two channel models are comparable, given that the both modeled channels have same parameters and antenna directions.
